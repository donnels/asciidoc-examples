== VSR logo description

The VSR logo was created from a 2d table of 8x8 with 8 data points with only one data point in each row and column. This then was made 3 dimentional and the points are further distributed to be only one in each row and column no matter from which side the 3d cube is viewed.
While it's entirely possible to just distribute the points down a straight line through the cube they are distributed to make the 8 corners of a further cube like object within the outter cube.
The inner cube is skewed due to the constraints of the placements and it is this shape which is desired. 
The overall idea behind this is that the inner cube when subtracted from the outer cube leaves a space within, virtual space, and it is defined by data points, nodes, in a multidimenional table, and connexions between the nodes, edges, that together represent a graph and an object. This represents the communication in Virtual Space and Global Communications Research.
The original log also has an at symbol in the center which is not shown in the SCAD file.
The idea behind the @ was to make it clear that communications is being referred to but it is redundant because the inner cube/graph represents a network.
