= Data cleansing tools

== Background

Data arrives from various data sources (e.g. Switch data, Router Data, Elevation data, Cabling data) and so therefore varies in type of file (csv, xls) as well as the number and type of columns in the data set. In addition, the data format may differ depending on the vendor (MAC address formats, for example.). These all need to be somehow smoothed out so that an upload into a neo4j database can be achieved with relative ease.

The function of this repository is to assist in the cleaning and importing of data into neo4J.

The suite of Python files has been developed to facilitate and automate the process of analysing CSV files. The main objectives being:

* to assist in diagram representation (creating uml files)
* process csv files ready for import into neo4j
